# hello-world
  Forging forward in the world, I hereby create this GitHub account to connect, engage and collaborate with my fellow geeks, enthusiasts, tech-heads, and all others alike!
  I'd heard of GitHub before, but it wasn't until I began using QGIS and ran into analytical issues (and requested help) that I was led here. You can lead a geek to ones and zeroes, and you sure as hell can make 'em decode messages! 

  I'm very much looking forward to traversing the depths of GitHub, and working with others to create, fix, and innovate the tech we use. Onward!
